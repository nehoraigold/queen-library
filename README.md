# queen-library

This library contains 5 basic methods based on the band Queen:

* Queen.bohemianRhapsody()
* Queen.rideMyBicycle()
* Queen.anotherOne(input)
* Queen.willRock(input)
* Queen.somebodyToLove(input)

The first two functions do not need an output; the last three do. Each of them has a response (usually in the console) depending on
the value provided.

Enjoy!
